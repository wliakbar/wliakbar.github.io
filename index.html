      <h3>Basketball</h3>
       <p>Basketball has to be my favorite sport to play! Despite not being gifted with the ideal basketball player height, I have loved the game for its competitive yet friendly nature. Playing this sport has allowed me to realize that skills that one uses and learns on the court while playing can also be applied outside of the court.</p>

      <p>Writing is another activity that gives me a lot of joy. It can very well be argued that writining is a form of meditation as it empowers one to freely experess themselves. Part of my high schools writing club, my writing pieces were often published in the schools literary maganize. </p>
